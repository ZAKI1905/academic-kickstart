abstract = "Two theoretically well-motivated gauge extensions of the standard model are $SU(3)_C\\times SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_R$ and $SU(3)_q\\times SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_l \\times SU(3)_R$ , where $SU(3)_q$ is the same as $SU(3)_C$ and $SU(3)_l$ is its color leptonic counterpart. Each has three variations, according to how $SU(3)_R$ is broken. It is shown here for the first time that a built-in dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry exists in all six versions. However, the corresponding symmetry breaking pattern does not reduce properly to that of the standard model, unless an additional $Z_2'$ symmetry is defined, so that $U(1)_D\\times Z_2'$ is broken to $Z_2$ dark parity. The available dark matter candidates in each case include fermions, scalars, as well as vector gauge bosons . This work points to the possible unity of matter with dark matter, the origin of which may not be ad hoc."
