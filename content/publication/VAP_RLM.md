abstract = "If leptons do not couple directly to the one Higgs doublet of the standard model of particle interactions, they must still do so somehow indirectly to acquire mass, as proposed recently in several models where it happens in one loop through dark matter. We analyze the important consequences of this scenario in a specific model, including Higgs decay, muon anomalous magnetic moment, $\\mu \\to e\\gamma$, $\\mu \\to eee$, and the proposed dark sector."
