abstract = "The $[SU(3)]^4$ quartification model of Babu, Ma, and Willenbrock (BMW), proposed in $2003$, predicts a confining leptonic color $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry, which becomes strong at the keV scale. It also predicts the existence of three families of half-charged leptons (hemions) below the TeV scale. These hemions are confined to form bound states which are not so easy to discover at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, just as $J/\\psi$ and $\\upsilon$ appeared as sharp resonances in $e^-e^+$ colliders of the 20th century, the corresponding ‘hemionium’ states are expected at a future $e^-e^+$ collider of the 21st century."
