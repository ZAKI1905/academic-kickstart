abstract = "The alternative $[SU(3)]^4$ model of leptonic color and dark matter is discussed. It unifies at $M_U\\sim 10^{14}$ GeV and has the low-energy subgroup $SU(3)_q\\times SU(2)_l\\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_X$ with $(u,h)_R$ instead of $(u,d)_R$ as doublets under $SU(2)_R$. It has the built-in global $U(1)$ dark symmetry which is generalized $Bâ€“L$. In analogy to $SU(3)_q$ quark triplets, it has $SU(2)_l$ hemion doublets which have half-integral charges and are confined by $SU(2)_l$ gauge bosons (stickons). In analogy to quarkonia, their vector bound states (hemionia) are uniquely suited for exploration at a future $e^-e^+$ collider."
