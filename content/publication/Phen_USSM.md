abstract = "We study the 2010 specific version of the 2002 proposed U$(1)_X$ extension of the supersymmetric standard model, which has no $\\mu$ term and conserves baryon number and lepton number separately and automatically. We consider in detail the scalar sector as well as the extra $Z_X$ gauge boson, and their interactions with the necessary extra color-triplet particles of this model, which behave as leptoquarks. We show how the diphoton excess at $750$ GeV, recently observed at the LHC, may be explained within this context. We identify a new fermion dark-matter candidate and discuss its properties. An important byproduct of this study is the discovery of relaxed supersymmetric constraints on the Higgs boson's mass of $125$ GeV."
