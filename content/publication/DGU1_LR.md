abstract = "An alternative left–right model of quarks and leptons, where the SU$(2)_R$ lepton doublet $(\\nu,l)_R$ is replaced with $(n,l)_R$ so that $n_R$ is not the Dirac mass partner of $\\nu_L$ , has been known since 1987. Previous versions assumed a global U$(1)_S$ symmetry to allow n to be identified as a dark-matter fermion. We propose here a gauge extension by the addition of extra fermions to render the model free of gauge anomalies, and just one singlet scalar to break U$(1)_S$ . This results in two layers of dark matter, one hidden behind the other."
