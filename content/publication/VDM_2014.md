abstract = "Models of fermion and scalar dark matter abound. Here we consider instead vector dark matter, from an SU$(2)_N$ extension of the standard model. It has a number of interesting properties, including a possible implementation of the inverse seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass. The annihilation of dark matter for calculating its relic abundance in this model is not dominated by its cross-section to standard-model particles, but rather to other new particles which are in thermal equilibrium with those of the standard model."
