abstract = "We propose an extension of the Standard Model of quarks and leptons to include gauge $B-L$ symmetry with an exotic array of neutral fermion singlets for anomaly cancellation. With the addition of suitable scalars also transforming under $U(1) B-L$, this becomes a model of radiative seesaw neutrino mass with possible multipartite dark matter. If leptoquark fermions are added, necessarily also transforming under $U(1) B-L$, the diphoton excess at $750$ GeV, recently observed at the Large Hadron Collider, may also be explained."
