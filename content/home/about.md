# Biography

Mohammadreza Zakeri is a postdoc researcher at the Institute of Theoretical Physics (ITP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). His research is focused primarily on models beyond the Standard Model (SM), designed for the purpose of explaining the nature of Dark Matter (DM) and the origin of neutrino mass. He works on gauge extensions of the SM, radiative mass generation, direct and indirect signatures of DM in experiments. Cosmic ray detection is one of the indirect probes of DM that he mainly studies. His work also involves testing various models against the data from particle colliders using computer simulation.
